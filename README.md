# David-Programming-Projects
My Python and Arduino programs are from personal projects.
The C-sharp games were made for a high school programming course, and they run in Visual Studio.
The Verilog computer was made for a UBC course, and it runs in ModelSim and on an FPGA board. The output file is lab7bonus_top.sof
